abstract = {Cold and isospin-symmetric nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities is known to form the so-called pasta structures, which, in turn, are known to undergo peculiar phase transitions. Here we investigate if such pastas and their phase changes survive in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter, and whether the symmetry energy of such pasta configurations is connected to the isospin content, the morphology of the pasta and to the phase transitions. We find that indeed pastas are formed in isospin asymmetric systems with proton to neutron ratios of x=0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, densities in the range of 0.05 fm−3{\textless}$\rho${\textless}0.08 fm−3, and temperatures T{\textless}2 MeV. Using tools (such as the caloric curve, Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution function, Kolmogorov statistic, and Euler functional) on the composition of the pasta, determined the existence of homogeneous structures, tunnels, empty regions, cavities and transitions among these regions. The symmetry energy was observed to attain different values in the different phases showing its dependence on the morphology of the nuclear matter structure.},

@article{GimenezMolinelli2015,
abstract = {In this work we study molecular dynamics simulations of symmetric nuclear and neutron star matter using a semi-classical nucleon interaction model. Our aim is to gain insight on the nature of the so-called "finite size effects", unavoidable in this kind of simulations, and to understand what they actually affect. To do so, we explore different geometries for the periodic boundary conditions imposed on the simulation cell: cube, hexagonal prism and truncated octahedron. For nuclear matter simulations we show that, at sub-saturation densities and low temperatures, the solutions are non-homogeneous structures reminiscent of the "nuclear pasta" phases expected in neutron star matter simulations, but only one structure per cell and shaped by specific artificial aspects of the simulations-for the same physical conditions (i.e. number density and temperature) different cells yield different solutions. The particular shape of the solution at low enough temperature and a given density can be predicted analytically by surface minimization. We also show that even if this behavior is due to the imposition of periodic boundary conditions on finite systems, this does not mean that it vanishes for very large systems, and it is actually independent of the system size. We conclude that, for nuclear matter simulations, the cells' size sets the only characteristic length scale for the inhomogeneities, and the geometry of the periodic cell determines the shape of those inhomogeneities.To model neutron star matter we add a screened Coulomb interaction between protons, and perform simulations in the three cell geometries. Our simulations indeed produce the well known nuclear pasta, with (in most cases) several structures per cell. However, we find that for systems not too large results are affected by finite size in different ways depending on the geometry of the cell. In particular, at the same certain physical conditions and system size, the hexagonal prism yields a single structure per cell while the cubic and truncated octahedron show consistent results, with more than one structure per cell. For systems of the size studied in this work these effects are still noticeable, but we find evidence to support that the dependence of the results on the cell geometry becomes smaller as the system size is increased. When the Coulomb interaction is present, the competition between opposing interactions of different range results in a proper, physically meaningful length scale that is independent of the system size and periodic cell of choice. Only under these conditions "finite size effects" will vanish for large enough systems (i.e. cells much larger than this characteristic length). Larger simulations are in order, but our computational capabilities forbid it for the time being.},

abstract = {Ideal nuclear matter is expected to undergo a first order phase transition at the thermodynamic limit. At such phase transitions the size of density fluctuations (bubbles or droplets) scale with the size of the system. This means that simulations of nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities will inexorably suffer from what is vaguely referred to as "finite size effects". It is usually thought that these finite size effects can be diminished by imposing periodic boundary conditions and making the system large enough, but as we show in this work, that is actually not the case at sub-saturation densities. In this paper we analyze the equilibrium configurations of molecular dynamics simulations of a classical model for symmetric ideal (uncharged) nuclear matter at sub-saturation densities and low temperatures, where phase coexistence is expected at the thermodynamic limit. We show that the most stable configurations in this density range are almost completely determined by artificial aspects of the simulations (i.e. boundary conditions) and can be predicted analytically by surface minimization. This result is very general and is shown to hold true for several well known semi-classical models of nuclear interaction and even for a simple Lennard-Jones potential. Also, in the limit of very large systems, when "small size" effects can be neglected, those equilibrium configurations seem to be restricted to a few structures reminiscent to the "Pasta Phases" expected in Neutron Star matter, but arising from a completely different origin: In Neutron Star matter, the non-homogeneous structures arise from a competition between nuclear and Coulomb interactions while for ideal nuclear matter they emerge from finite (yet not "small") size effects. The role of periodic boundary conditions and finite size effects in Neutron Star matter simulations are reexamined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {We review a molecular dynamics method for nucleon many-body systems called the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) and our studies using this method. These studies address the structure and the dynamics of nuclear matter relevant to the neutron star crusts, supernova cores, and heavy-ion collisions. A key advantage of QMD is that we can study dynamical processes of nucleon many-body systems without any assumptions on the nuclear structure. First we focus on the inhomogeneous structures of low-density nuclear matter consisting not only of spherical nuclei but also of nuclear "pasta", i.e., rod-like and slab-like nuclei. We show that the pasta phases can appear in the ground and equilibrium states of nuclear matter without assuming nuclear shape. Next we show our simulation of compression of nuclear matter which corresponds to the collapsing stage of supernovae. With increase of density, a crystalline solid of spherical nuclei change to a triangular lattice of rods by connecting neighboring nuclei. Finally, we discuss the fragment formation in expanding nuclear matter. Our results suggest that a generally accepted scenario based on the liquid-gas phase transition is not plausible at lower temperatures.},

abstract = {When a fluid at a constant density rho in between the densities of coexisting vapor (rhov) and liquid (rhol) at temperatures below criticality is studied in a (cubic) box of finite linear dimension L , phase separation occurs in this finite volume, provided L is large enough. For a range of densities, one can observe a liquid droplet (at density rhol' slightly exceeding rhol) coexisting in stable thermal equilibrium with surrounding vapor (with density rhov'{\textgreater}rhov, so in the thermodynamic limit such a vapor would be supersaturated). We show, via Monte Carlo simulations of a Lennard-Jones model of a fluid and based on a phenomenological thermodynamic analysis, that via recording the chemical potential micro as function of rho, one can obtain precise estimates of the droplet surface free energy for a wide range of droplet radii. We also show that the deviations of this surface free energy from the prediction based on the "capillarity approximation" of classical nucleation theory (i.e., using the interfacial free energy of a flat liquid-vapor interface for the surface free energy of a droplet irrespective of its radius) are rather small. We also study carefully the limitation of the present method due to the "droplet evaporation/condensation transition" occurring for small volumes and demonstrate that very good equilibrium is achieved in our study, by showing that the radial profile of the local chemical potential from the droplet center to the outside is perfectly flat.},
